# Reservation

This project is focused on building out the front-end component of a local eateries reservation component. My particular focus was building out the Calendar and Reservations module.

## Usage
From within the root directoy

```sh
- Create a local instance of a MySQL database 
- mysql -u root 
- create database reservations
- 'npm run build'
- 'npm start'
- 'npm run seed' to seed your local MySQL database

```
Open up localhost:3000
